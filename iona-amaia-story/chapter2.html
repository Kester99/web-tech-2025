    <!-- Paragraph with a highlighted element -->
    <p>The <span class="highlight green">glowing butterfly</span> flew ahead, lighting the way through the mist.  
    As they walked forward, the mist began to <strong>open like a curtain</strong>.</p>

    <!-- Library description -->
    <p>In front of them was a <span class="highlight yellow">library like no other</span>.  
    Shelves made of branches reached high into the sky, and books floated all around,  
    flipping their pages like they were talking to each other.</p>

    <!-- Dialogue -->
    <p>"This place feels alive," <span class="name-highlight">Iona</span> whispered as a book gently floated toward them and opened on its own.</p>

    <p><span class="name-highlight">Amaia</span> slowly reached out and touched the glowing pages.  
    Then, a soft voice echoed through the air:</p>

    <!-- Riddle setup -->
    <p><strong>"To learn the secret, you must answer this riddle..."</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Riddle:</strong> 
      <span class="highlight yellow">"I have keys but open no locks, I have space but no room,  
      you can enter but not go outside. What am I?"</span>
    </p>

    <p>They looked at each other. <strong>The answer was closeâ€”they just had to find it.</strong></p>
